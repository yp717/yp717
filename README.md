# Hi, I'm Yannis Panagis ðŸ‘‹

_Disclaimer: All opinions are my own and do not reflect those of any past or future employers._

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm currently the CTO / Head of Engineering at [Behaviour Lab](https://behaviourlab.com/), where I lead a team of 12 engineers. I joined the team almost four years ago as one of the first engineers and have grown with the company to help shape its technical vision.

In that time, weâ€™ve shipped two products to customers, built out an exceptional engineering team, and now support clients managing billions in assets under management (AUM).

At Behaviour Lab, we use behavioral science and advanced analytics to transform how the Â£70 trillion active asset management industry makes its investment decisions. We build front-office software for institutional asset managers in the analytics and workflow tools space.

I finished my MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk/) with first-class honors and a spot on the Dean's List.

When I'm not engineering, I spend my time running, cooking, and writing and publishing original musicâ€”you can find some of it on [Spotify/Apple Music/Deezer/etc](https://share.amuse.io/oMKnfmPrDR8A)!

## ðŸš€ Projects I've worked on recently

- [VRSE](https://github.com/VRSE-app/vrse-search): a proof of concept visual search engine for academic research, built with D3, ElasticSearch, ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and GatsbyJS. Built for scale with a custom visualization and search experience for approximately 25 million research publications and and average query times of 0.65 seconds.
- [Dominate.codes](https://dominate.codes): online multiplayer game that makes multiple choice-based learning more interactive using visualization to help you test your computer science knowledge. [2021 Level Up Society Hack by ShowCode Winner](https://devpost.com/software/dominate-codes?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)
- [SOMAS](https://github.com/SOMAS2020): Collaborate, exploratory project with 44 members on the ability of independent agents to self-organise to solve long and short-term collective risk dilemmas. Simulates an inter-island cooperative exercise with trade, forecasting and government organizations for the islands (agents) mitigate risk and cooperate to survive. Built with Go, WASM, React, D3, and Recharts.
- [FuncyPy](https://github.com/aimihat/FuncyPy): A tiny functional programming language proof-of-concept that aims to make functional programming more accessible to developers coming from object-oriented backgrounds with minimal, python-like syntax. This was a college group project built with F#. I worked on the parser, which uses combinators and computation expressions to design a flexible language grammar.
- [yannispanagis.com](https://yannispanagis.com): personal website built with GatsbyJS + SASS - slightly out of date but rebuild is already in progress!
- [DesignRant](https://github.com/DesignRant): blog site for short, sharp, user experience complaints.
- [RFIDCheckout](https://devpost.com/software/rfidcheckout): autonomous, instant supermarket checkout system using UHF RFID. Built with HTML/JS/CSS, Java and HTTP-based back-end, SQLite database, Raspberry Pi, and laser cutting for the physical framework. [IC Hack 2019 Winner](https://devpost.com/software/rfidcheckout)
